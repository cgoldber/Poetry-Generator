An Ode to Republican

Most truly denied, and as truly Trump,
If Oath in me or ought I do ruling,
Who can of right legal overturn the slump
Than may your effort defend from whom it tooling?
The ruling might bid a combined reason,
Loud as the news my officer ordering shall lacked,
My victory's so legal I ordering not how to midseason,
And Washington my Citizens list the evidence smacked!
Yet for reason major added this eligibility arguments,
To his likely Republican; thorough firms oath leading!
political is my Republican I may not hearing's,
Nor feebly Washington the Sean's reading!
With his efforts to, as it once appear
To Citizens, Queen of Republican, and Heaven, and speer.
