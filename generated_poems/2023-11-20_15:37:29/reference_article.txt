            Dolphins vs. Raiders score, takeaways: Miami holds off pesky Las Vegas to remain undefeated at home
        
            Miami wins a close one at home
        
The Miami Dolphins remain undefeated at home after defeating the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 11, 20-13. This was not the blowout some were anticipating, as the Dolphins turned the ball over three times and left the door open for the Raiders offense until the very end.
Raiders rookie quarterback Aidan O'Connell had a chance to lead a game-tying drive late in the fourth quarter, but was picked off by Jalen Ramsey in the end zone for his second interception with just 30 seconds remaining. O'Connell completed 24 of 41 passes for 271 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. All three turnovers came in the second half. Josh Jacobs struggled on the ground, managing just 39 yards on 14 carries. Davante Adams caught seven passes for 82 yards and a touchdown.
For the Dolphins, they didn't look on point coming off their bye. Tua Tagovailoa completed 28 of 39 passes for 325 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Raheem Mostert rushed for 86 yards on 22 carries, while rookie De'Von Achane left the contest in the first quarter with a knee injury and did not return. Tyreek Hill caught 10 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown, but played through a hand injury that caused him to miss some time in the second quarter.
Let's take a look at what went down in Miami on Sunday.
Why the Dolphins won
Miami's offense was not as explosive Sunday, as the Dolphins registered just 20 points, which marked a season low at home. It gave O'Connell and Co. some hope, but the Dolphins defense wasn't about to allow an upset.
Miami's defense gave up just one touchdown all game, zero points in the second half and forced three O'Connell turnovers in the final two quarters. The Raiders' second half drive chart went like this: Three-and-out, interception, three-and-out, punt, turnover on downs, interception, interception. The Raiders went 4 of 14 on third downs, and 0-for-2 on fourth downs. If the Dolphins defense wasn't up to the task every time it took the field on Sunday, Vegas could have pulled off the upset.
Why the Raiders lost
It would be easy to say the Raiders just don't possess the kind of offensive firepower the Dolphins do, but what really decided this game was turnovers. Las Vegas' inability to cash in on the turnovers its defense created, and the three turnovers the offense committed in the second half.
The Raiders forced and recovered a Tagovailoa fumble on the Dolphins' first possession. It set Vegas up with the ball on the Miami 30-yard line. The Raiders gained just 14 yards, and kicked a field goal. Late in the second quarter, the Raiders forced and recovered another fumble. It set Vegas up with possession at the Miami 32-yard line. The Raiders then gained just 3 yards, and kicked another field goal. On the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Tagovailoa threw an interception. The Raiders then went three-and-out, and punted the ball back to Miami.
The Raiders defense was impressive on Sunday. Unfortunately, the offense ran into problems.
Turning point
As we mentioned, the Raiders were in this game until the very end. O'Connell got the ball back with 1:58 remaining in the game at his own 7-yard line, but had zero timeouts. He led the Raiders 54 yards down the field on nine plays to get into enemy territory, but aggressively went for the end zone with 32 seconds left, and was picked off by Ramsey.
Play of the game
Speaking of Ramsey, he had an interception in the third quarter as well. Check out this diving effort:
The veteran defensive back has recorded three interceptions in three games played this season. He will be an important piece for Miami as the Dolphins prepare for what they hope is a deep playoff run.
What's next
The Raiders return to Vegas to play host to the rival Kansas City Chiefs. As for the Dolphins, they are on a short week, and will play the Jets at home on Black Friday.
O'Connell is picked off by Jalen Ramsey in the end zone! His second INT of the game!
Looks like he had the wind knocked out of him.
O'Connell finds Davante Adams for a huge gain of 20.
This Dolphins offense has just 6 points in the second half. Miami goes 12 yards on 5 plays, and punts the ball away after Connor Williams was caught on a false start on fourth-and-five.
So, the Raiders have one more chance to tie this game. Need to go 93 yards in 1:58 with zero timeouts.
O'Connell is wrapped up by Christian Wilkins, tries to throw it up, and it's picked off by Jaelan Philips. Still 3 minutes left though.
Renfrow has 38 yards receiving on this drive on 2 catches. Vegas facing a fourth-and-6. Going for it.
Dolphins to punt after going three-and-out. Tua and Co. are really leaving the door open for a game-tying touchdown here.
Miami up 7 with 6:21 remaining in the fourth quarter.
Raiders turn it over on downs after O'Connell can't connect with Jakobi Meyers deep down the left sideline. 8:26 left in the game.
The Raiders have just 179 yards of total offense.
It's the Sanders show now. First 50-plus-yard field goal of the season for him. He's good from 51 yards out.
This has not been the cleanest game for the Dolphins, obviously.
LV 13 MIA 20 25 seconds remaining in the third quarter
Raiders go three-and-out for the fourth time today. Josh Jacobs runs aren't working. He has 11 rushes for 27 yards.
Sanders redemption. He's good from 41 yards out. Caps a seven-play, 30-yard drive for Miami.
LV 13 MIA 17 5:26 left in the third quarter
What a pick!
Jason Sanders missed a 50-yard field goal. Feels like he hasn't kicked many field goals this year.
Raiders go three-and-out after the interception. Two Jacobs runs for -1 yards and a nine-yard pass to Mayer.
That's been a key storyline today, the Raiders have just 6 points off of 3 turnovers.
Speaking of turnovers, on the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Tua Tagovailoa throws an interception deep. 3 turnovers for the Dolphins.
The Dolphins probably should be up 21-7, but turnovers really hurt them in the first half. 2 fumbles gifted 2 FGs to the Raiders.
